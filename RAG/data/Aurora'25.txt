Date and Time:
Day 1: 
5:30 PM - 8:30 PM
Club:
Blank_101


This event will have all the participants working in a group, the number of groups being an even number. Two teams will get selected and will be given a debate topic assigned to them, be it proprietary vs open source, against vs for AI deepfakes, etc. and each team must present their sides of the argument in front of the classroom and the other teams will vote for which team had the better points, presentation, argument and whichever team gets the most points (The mediator will be the tie breaker in case there is one) gets to remain while the other team will get eliminated. After each team has participated at least once the number of people remaining will be reduced and teams will get shuffled and this continues until only two teams remain, then they have one final debate to end all debates. After which the team voted by whoever remains plus the mediator will get crowned the ultimate king of debates.
